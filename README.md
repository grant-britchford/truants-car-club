CRITERIA

This website is for the owners of classic cars that would like to be able to show these cars at organised events.
The website let's the owner look at forthcoming events that have been arranged and lets them join in with the events and
lets them join the club if they so wish. The website also caters for the classic car enthusiast by letting them see the events details
and letting them join up to a newsletter on classic car news.

FEATURES

*Truants Car Club website includes a header and footer on every page, and are responsive over all devices.

*All pages on mobile have a drop down nav bar menu to save space and has a menu toggle button to show how to reveal the menu. This button is in the same place on all mobile devices.

*On laptops and desktop computers the navbar menu is constantly open, but has a color change when hovering over the menu items. All pages are connected so the user doesn't need to use the back button.

LANDING PAGE

The landing page is the first page the user will come to when connecting to the site. This page is made up of the Header and Body, which consists of a background image and an About sectio for the user to see what can be done and how to get there.


EVENTS PAGE

The events page is the second page on the site and holds the details of upcoming events. This page is made up of the Header and nav bar and again consists of a background image and the details of all the upcoming events including place, date and times.

SIGN UP PAGE

IMPROVEMENTS

I would like to add a map to the bottom of the events page with pins in to show the exact location of the events and to show the charity run route so the general public know where the cars are heading to and which towns and cities they're going through.
