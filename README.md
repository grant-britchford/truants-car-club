# Truants Car Club

DEPLOYMENT

Deployment was carried out when the basic structure of the website was done. this was to be able to find any bugs that needed fixing and to give the developer
a chance to check that any future work and updates sat where they were placed.

The live link is: <https://grant-britchford.github.io/truants-car-club/>

CRITERIA

This website is for the owners of classic cars that would like to be able to show these cars at organised events.
The website let's the owner look at forthcoming events that have been arranged and lets them join in with the events and
lets them jouin the club if they so wish. The website also caters for the classic car enthusiast by letting them see the events details
and letting them join up to a newsletter on classic car news.

DESIGN

*All colors are sourced from google color charts and are specific to racing colors of Formula 1. Some of these colors were slightly changed to pass the color contrast tests.

*media images sourced from canva and pexel image sites.

*Favicon sourced from Icons8

*Fonts sourced from Google Fonts and are matched to the car idea.

IMPROVEMENTS

I would like to add a map to the bottom of the events page with pins in to show excat location of the events and to show the charity run route so the general public know where the cars are heading to and which towns and cities their going thhrough.
