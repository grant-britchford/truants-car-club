# Truants Car Club

DEPLOYMENT

Deployment was carried out when the basic structure of the website was done. this was to be able to find any bugs that needed fixing and to give the developer
a chance to check that any future work and updates sat where they were placed.

The live link is: <https://grant-britchford.github.io/truants-car-club/>

CRITERIA

This website is for the owners of classic cars that would like to be able to show these cars at organised events.
The website let's the owner look at forthcoming events that have been arranged and lets them join in with the events and
lets them jouin the club if they so wish. The website also caters for the classic car enthusiast by letting them see the events details
and letting them join up to a newsletter on classic car news.

FEATURES

The website has features including, a nav bar element, a header element, a body element and a footer element. as well as icons and fonts.

LANDING PAGE

The landing page is the first page you come to when you link to the site. This page gives you an overall outline of what the site is about
and where to find each element.

EVENTS PAGE

The events page is the second page on the site and holds the details for upcoming events. The header is the same and the footer is the same the difference is the background image and the layout of the events.

SIGN UP PAGE

the sign up page again has the same header and footer as the rest of the pages and has a different background image and has the form to be be filled out and sent.

FOOTER

The footer is a basic footer showing the media links associated with club and copyright information.

Testing was carried out each day on both the HTML code and The CSS code. These tests were carried out using,

*FreeFormatter Validator for the HTML validation.

*CSSPortal for the CSS validation.

DESIGN

*All colors are sourced from google color charts and are specific to racing colors of Formula 1.

*media images sourced from canva and pexel image sites.

*Favicon sourced from Icons8

*Fonts sourced from Google Fonts and are matched to the car idea.

IMPROVEMENTS

I would like to add a map to the bottom of the events page with pins in to show excat location of the events and to show the charity run route so the general public know where the cars are heading to and which towns and cities their going thhrough.
